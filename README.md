# About Amino For Desktop
Aminoâ„¢ For Desktop is a small Gecko-based application for using Amino easily on your Windows computer. I have made this open-source as I would like people to help on this project and add new features etc.

The goal is to create a nice alternative to using Amino on phones since who wants to use a phone all the time? Phones have small screens and are a pain to use if you want to get something productive done. (That's why the iPad Pro fails so hard.)

# Download
